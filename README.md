#### ACT NOW and QSIDE collaborate with community partners nationwide to develop new approaches to public safety that move beyond traditional policing models. Our partnerships range from small, rural communities like Martin County, Kentucky, with a population of about 11,000, to urban neighborhoods like Austin on Chicago’s west side, the most populous neighborhood in the city. Our collaborative is working to address critical issues such as gun violence, the opioid crisis, and other significant challenges faced by our partner communities. In this project, you’ll gather data from public websites and APIs, clean and organize the data, and use Tableau to create visualizations that provide actionable insights into key indicators of community health, supporting our partners with an evidence-base to help drive their strategies for addressing these challenges.
